                                <p>To kick off the project, I started with some usability testing for the purpose of
                                    gaining some deep qualitative insights into the usability of existing flight-booking
                                    apps. The first step was to define my objectives and to decide exactly what I wanted
                                    to achieve from the usability tests. I created a recruitment screener, a consent
                                    form and a script for both mobile and desktop usability testing sessions. Careful
                                    attention was paid during the writing of the scripts to ensure that I didn't ask
                                    leading questions or closed questions that would be unfruitful. After doing this
                                    preliminary work, I conducted two mobile and two desktop usability tests on the SAA
                                    Airways and Mango Airways websites.</p>
                                <div class="card-text post-details-text">

                                        <li>Discover where and when users feel empowered and frustrated during the

                                    <p>The next step was to prepare a script for depth interviews for the purpose of
                                        gaining some insights into context of use. The aim was to understand which
                                        flight-booking websites users prefer and why. Scope also included how many times
                                        users typically return to a website before making a purchase and how users share
                                        information with one another when choosing flights as a group.</p>

                                    <p>On top of the usability testing and depth interviews, I wanted to draw some
                                        learning from best-in-class competitor websites and apps. I researched four
                                        flight-booking websites, and four mobile flight-booking apps by taking
                                        screenshots from each stage of the journey and assessing what had been done
                                        well, what had been done badly and which things are standard features that users
                                        expect.</p>

                                    <p>I created an online survey using Survey Monkey for some more
                                        quantitative-attitudinal research to gain more understanding into context of
                                        use. I used a mixture of open and closed questions as well as some multiple
                                        choice questions. The survey would take around 2-3 minutes for people to
                                        complete.</p>

                                        usability test and took notes. I then wrote each point down. I also went through
                                        the the depth interviews, competitor benchmarking document and survey results. I
                                        got stuck in a room and sorting them into categories to create an affinity
                                        diagram. Some clear categories emerged.</p>

                                    <p>I took the information from the affinity diagram and organized it into a step by

                                    <p>Finally, I created an empathy map showing the user's goals along with what they
                                        say, think, feel and do, since sometime what people say isn't always reflected
                                        by what they do. This helped me to empathize with the user, to gain a greater
                                        understanding of context of use, and to add to my background information of
                                        typical users.</p>

                                    <p>The three key insights I gained by using these research methods were a). that
                                        error messages can be very unhelpful when it comes to informing the user about
                                        problems- how it can be avoided / resolved and what to do next, b). that users
                                        typically skip the add-ons section and c). that users prefer to check out as a
                                        guest rather than creating an account. Focus on these areas could prevent a lot
                                        of friction.</p>

                                    <p style="color: #c4cfde;"><b>Mobile Flow Chart</b></p>
                                    <p>Using the finding from my research, I was able to create a mobile flowchart aimed
                                        at mitigating some of the issues that I discovered. Given that there is a large
                                        number of ways that a user could use a flight-booking site, I decided to narrow
                                        my scope to a linear primary use case. This was partly because all four of my
                                        usability test candidates skipped the “add-ons” and “create account” sections.
                                        Moreover, flight booking journeys tend to be very linear with later steps
                                        depending on earlier steps.</p>

                                    <p style="color: #c4cfde;"><b>Define Navigation</b></p>
                                    <p>Here are some sketches I did while thinking through the navigation. On desktop,
                                        the idea was to have a primary and a secondary nav bar that are displayed at all
                                        times, except when the user is in the “checkout” part of the journey, at which
                                        point, the nav bar would be hidden to remove unnecessary distractions. In the
                                        place of the nav bar, the user will see a “back” button and a progress bar, to
                                        indicate how much is left to complete. On mobile, the primary navigation will be
                                        off-canvas and will only be visible when the menu icon has been tapped. However,
                                        secondary navigation icons will be visible until the user enters the checkout.
                                        The decision was made to use an of-canvas navigation on mobile because the
                                        primary purpose of the website is to book flights, so other areas of the website
                                        are seen as secondary use cases.</p>

                                    <p style="color: #c4cfde;"><b>Mobile Interaction Design</b></p>
                                    <p>The next step in the design process was to decide how each element on the page
                                        would work when the user interacts with it. I wanted to make the forms on each
                                        page as easy to complete as possible so I ensured that the appropriate keyboard
                                        would be displayed for each input field.</p>
